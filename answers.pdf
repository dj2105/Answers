(Question 4) Tj
T*
(A. In triangle ACB, 55 + 80 + y = 180, so y = 45 deg.) Tj
T*
(Since BE is parallel to AC, angle x equals angle between AC and AB, so x = 55 deg.) Tj
T*
(B. Triangle: 72 + 2x + 4y = 180 -> x + 2y = 54.) Tj
T*
(Linear pair: 4y + 5x = 180. Solve -> x = 24, y = 15.) Tj

(Question 5) Tj
T*
(A. 4\(2x+1\) + 3\(5x-2\) = 8x+4+15x-6 = 23x-2.) Tj
T*
(B. -2a\(a-3y\) - a\(a+4y\) = -3a^2 + 2ay.) Tj
T*
(C. \(x+4\)\(x-3\) = x^2 + x - 12.) Tj

(Question 6) Tj
T*
(If t=4 and p=-3, then 2t - 3p^2 = 8 - 27 = -19.) Tj
T*

T*
(Question 7) Tj
T*
(A. 2r + 7 = 4r - 5 -> 12 = 2r -> r = 6.) Tj
T*
(B. 5\(y-2\) + 12 = 2\(y-5\) -> 5y+2 = 2y-10 -> y = -4.) Tj

(Question 8) Tj
T*
(Let Bart have x euro. Lisa has x+12 and Maggie has 4x.) Tj
T*
(Equation: x + \(x+12\) = 4x -> x = 6. Bart has EUR6 \(Lisa EUR18, Maggie EUR24\).) Tj
T*

T*
(Question 9) Tj
T*
(Width = x cm, length = x+3 cm.) Tj
T*
(a\) Length = x+3 cm.) Tj
T*
(b\) Perimeter = 2\(x + x+3\) = 4x + 6 cm.) Tj
T*
(c\) 4x + 6 = 26 -> x = 5 cm.) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Question 10) Tj
T*
(A. 5x - 7 > 3 -> 5x > 10 -> x > 2, so x >= 3 for x in N.) Tj
T*
(B. 7x + 1 <= 3x - 15 -> 4x <= -16 -> x <= -4.) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Question 11) Tj
T*
(A. x + y = 5 and x - y = -7 -> 2x = -2 -> x = -1, y = 6.) Tj
